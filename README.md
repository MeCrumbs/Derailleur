A macOS app (for now) built to display the data from Flywheel at Home bikes without screens. As a result of the Peloton/Flywheel lawsuit, all Flywheel at Home workouts were stopped at the end of March 2020. Due to COVID-19, some (including myself) have been left with a Flywheel at Home bike that no longer has its companion mobile app, while waiting for Peloton replacements to be delivered.

I created this app to give new life to the Flywheel bike taking up a large amount of space in my tiny San Francisco apartment.
